# Public Bot
This Bot isn't public. It's only avaible on the CodeDecity Discord Server ((Try it out)[https://discord.gg/889PF8Q]) and it manages the roles and some permissions. In the future I will release a public version of this bot which you can setup for your personal preferences. Just wait and maybe use pull requests to get this bot early
